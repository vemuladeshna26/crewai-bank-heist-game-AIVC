ui_css_generation:
  description: >
    1. Read UI/UX requirements from {input_path} (theme colors, fonts, spacing, layout hints).  
    2. Load the static HTML template from {template_path}.  
    3. Locate—or insert if missing—a <canvas id="gameCanvas"> element where the game will render.  
    4. Create—a container for A panel showing three cards to the right inside the game container.  
    5. Generate semantic HTML for these elements, preserving the template’s existing structure.  
    6. Write responsive CSS inside a single <style> tag:
       - **Desktop**: canvas and controls side‑by‑side.  
       - **Mobile**: canvas stacked above controls.  
       - Apply your theme’s colors and typography. 
    7. Write **one** <style> tag (mobile-first):  
       - **≤ 800 px**:  
         * Canvas fills full width; card panel collapses into a fixed column on the right (vertical scroll allowed).  
         * Buttons scale to ≥ 48 px hit area.  
         * Hide purely decorative elements to maximise play area. 
         
       - **> 800 px**:  
         * Canvas and card panel sit side-by-side in a flex layout; card panel has a max-width so canvas dominates.  
       - Apply theme colours, typography, shadows, and subtle animations from requirements.  
       - Provide **cool-down styling** for disabled cards (e.g. grayscale + 60 % opacity).  
    8. Ensure **Play, Restart, Settings, Instructions** buttons remain visible and tappable at all break-points.   
    9. Wrap **only** the new markup + CSS in:
       <!-- UI/CSS Code Segment -->  
    10. Do **not** modify any other template content.
  expected_output: >
    HTML and CSS snippet labeled "UI/CSS Code Segment".

game_logic_generation:
  description: >
    1. Parse core mechanics from {input_path}: stealth rules, win/lose conditions, card effects. Integrate the movements of the player and enemies. 
    2. Confirm <canvas id="gameCanvas"> exists in the template.  
    3. Generate a GameLogic class in one <script> block with:
       - constructor(canvasId) to set up context and state.  
       - init() to initialize the grid and entity positions.  
       - draw() to render walls, player, enemies, and cards.  
       - movePlayer(direction) with boundary and collision checks.  
       - applyCardEffect(cardId) for cards when clicked.  
       - checkWinLose() to detect key pick‑up or enemy detection.  
       - Comments on each method.  
       - integrate player enemy movements in moveEnemy()
       - moveEnemy() to integrate enemy patrol / pursuit. 
       - ADD BUTTONS FOR MOVEMENTS INSTEAD OF touch controls, up/down/left/right buttons to used for moving the player. 
       - A 3x3 radar around the enemy, that is used to detect collision with the player.
       - If any cards are to be used, place them to the right in a container.
    4. Place the three card elements in the right-hand panel created by ui_css_generation.
    5. Label and output **only** this code as:
       // JavaScript Logic Segment  
    6. Do **not** touch any HTML outside this script block.
    
  expected_output: >
    JavaScript class implementing core gameplay logic, labeled "JavaScript Logic Segment".

user_input_generation:
  description: >
    Generate user input handling code based on control requirements from {input_path}.
    - Capture movement inputs (Arrow keys + WASD).
    - Capture touch gestures for mobile support.
    - Attach event listeners for Play, Restart, Settings, and Instructions buttons.
    - **If UI and Logic are separate, define a Game controller class that:**
      * Instantiates UI and Logic classes.
      * Connects button actions to game transitions.
      * Ensures Play button correctly starts the game.
    - Without this, navigation will break — prioritize correct wiring.
    - Label your output as // User Input Segment.
  expected_output: >
    JavaScript for user inputs + Game controller class, labeled "User Input Segment".

generate_image_assets:
  description: >
    Generate pixel-art and futuristic neon-style images for Bank Heist - Cards Edition based on {input_path}.
    - Use DallE or other image generation tools.
    - Save all images under images/ folder.
    - After saving images:
      * Create a manifest JSON file formatted as assets under which each filename and url is present
    - Ensure no extra metadata (only filename and url).
    - Save the manifest as images/manifest.json.
  expected_output: >
    - All generated images saved under images/.
    - A manifest.json listing assets with filename and URL format.
  agent: image_assets_agent

generate_audio_assets:
  description: >
    Generate stealth-themed background music and card sound effects based on {input_path}.
    - Save all audio files under sounds/ folder.
    - Create a manifest JSON file formatted as assets under which each filename and url is present
    - No extra metadata (only filename and url).
    - Save the manifest as sounds/manifest.json.
  expected_output: >
    - All generated sounds saved under sounds/.
    - A manifest.json listing sounds with filename and URL.
  agent: audio_assets_agent


integrate_assets:
  description: >
    Read the generated image and audio manifests.
    - Embed <img> and <audio> tags into {template_path}.
    - Update CSS backgrounds and JavaScript preload calls correctly.
    - Ensure that all asset paths are correctly referenced in the final game file.
    - Label code inserted as <!-- Asset Integration Code Segment -->.
  expected_output: >
    Updated HTML/CSS/JS snippets with embedded assets.
  agent: asset_integrator_agent

template_integration:
  description: >
    1. Load the template from {template_path}. Change the game title.
    2. Find placeholders:
       - [[UI_CSS]]  
       - [[JS_CODE]] inside GameLogic  class only
    3. Replace [[UI_CSS]] with the UI/CSS Code Segment (including the <style> tag).  
    4. In place of [[JS_CODE]], insert one <script> block that concatenates in order:
       a. Map Config Segment  
       b. JavaScript Logic Segment  
       c. User Input Segment  
    5. Ensure all other template HTML remains exactly as‑is and button IDs/classes stay intact.  The class Game should be the same, no changes in it.
    6. The Play/Settings/Instructions/Reset button in should work.
    6. Wrap the merged file in:
       <!-- Integrated HTML File -->
  expected_output: >
    Fully merged HTML file ready for gameplay.
