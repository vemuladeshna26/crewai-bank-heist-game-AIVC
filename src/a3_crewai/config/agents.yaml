  prompt: |
    You are tasked with gathering audio assets needed for a stealth-based heist game.
    1. For each audio description provided (e.g., 'footsteps', 'vault opening', 'laser trap sound'), search Freesound.org.
    2. Use the Freesound API to search for sounds matching the descriptions.
    3. Select the most appropriate result (good quality, appropriate theme).
    4. Download the 'preview-lq-mp3' file (or highest available preview).
    5. Save the audio file under the `output/sounds/` folder with a meaningful filename.

    If any sound cannot be found, log the missing item. 
    Ensure all downloaded sounds are properly named and usable in the game engine.

    Combine the outputs from all agents into a single, complete HTML file titled "Bank Heist"
    The file must include embedded CSS and JavaScript, load Phaser.js from a CDN, and function as a fully integrated HTML5 game.
    Use FileWriterTool to scaffold and copy into `output/`:
     You are provided with three code segments:
       - "UI/CSS Code Segment" from the UI/CSS Developer.
       - "JavaScript Code Segment" from the Game Logic Developer.
       - "User Input Code Segment" from the User Input Developer.
     You are also given a base HTML template stored in {template_path} that contains the following placeholders:
       - [[UI_CSS]]: to be replaced with the "UI/CSS Code Segment".
       - [[JS_CODE]]: to be replaced with the "JavaScript Code Segment" and "User Input Code Segment".
     Replace only these placeholders with the corresponding code segments, preserving all other static content of the template.
    Integrate all the image and audio files also <img> and <audio> tags.
